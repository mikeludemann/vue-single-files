    <p>Features of the Spotify music service are included on our pages. This service is provided by Spotify AB, Birger Jarlsgatan
        61, 113 56 Stockholm, Sweden. The Spotify plugins can be recognized by the green logo on our site. For an overview
        of the Spotify Plugins, see

    <p>Thus, when you visit our pages about the plugin a direct connection can be established between your browser and the Spotify
        server. This enables Spotify to receive information that you have visited our site from your IP address. If you click
        the Spotify button while you are logged into your Spotify account, you can link the content of our pages to your
        Spotify profile. This means that Spotify can associate visits to our pages with your user account.</p>
