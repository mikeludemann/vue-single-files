    <h3>Google Web Fonts</h3>
    <p>For uniform representation of fonts, this page uses web fonts provided by Google. When you open a page, your browser
      loads the required web fonts into your browser cache to display texts and fonts correctly.</p>
    <p>For this purpose your browser has to establish a direct connection to Google servers. Google thus becomes aware that
      our web page was accessed via your IP address. The use of Google Web fonts is done in the interest of a uniform and
      attractive presentation of our website. This constitutes a justified interest pursuant to Art. 6 (1) (f) DSGVO.</p>
    <p>If your browser does not support web fonts, a standard font is used by your computer.</p>
    <p>Further information about handling user data, can be found at
