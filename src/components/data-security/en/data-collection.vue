    <h2>Data collection on our website</h2>
    <h3>Cookies</h3>
    <p>Some of our web pages use cookies. Cookies do not harm your computer and do not contain any viruses. Cookies help make
        our website more user-friendly, efficient, and secure. Cookies are small text files that are stored on your computer
        and saved by your browser.</p>
    <p>Most of the cookies we use are so-called "session cookies." They are automatically deleted after your visit. Other cookies
        remain in your device's memory until you delete them. These cookies make it possible to recognize your browser when
        you next visit the site.</p>
    <p>You can configure your browser to inform you about the use of cookies so that you can decide on a case-by-case basis
        whether to accept or reject a cookie. Alternatively, your browser can be configured to automatically accept cookies
        under certain conditions or to always reject them, or to automatically delete cookies when closing your browser.
        Disabling cookies may limit the functionality of this website.</p>
    <p>Cookies which are necessary to allow electronic communications or to provide certain functions you wish to use (such
        as the shopping cart) are stored pursuant to Art. 6 paragraph 1, letter f of DSGVO. The website operator has a legitimate
        interest in the storage of cookies to ensure an optimized service provided free of technical errors. If other cookies
        (such as those used to analyze your surfing behavior) are also stored, they will be treated separately in this privacy
        policy.</p>
    <h3>Server log files</h3>
    <p>The website provider automatically collects and stores information that your browser automatically transmits to us in
        "server log files". These are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Browser type and browser version</li>
        <li>Operating system used</li>
        <li>Referrer URL</li>
        <li>Host name of the accessing computer</li>
        <li>Time of the server request</li>
        <li>IP address</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These data will not be combined with data from other sources.</p>
    <p>The basis for data processing is Art. 6 (1) (f) DSGVO, which allows the processing of data to fulfill a contract or for
        measures preliminary to a contract.</p>
    <h3>Contact form</h3>
    <p>Should you send us questions via the contact form, we will collect the data entered on the form, including the contact
        details you provide, to answer your question and any follow-up questions. We do not share this information without
        your permission.</p>
    <p>We will, therefore, process any data you enter onto the contact form only with your consent per Art. 6 (1)(a) DSGVO.
        You may revoke your consent at any time. An informal email making this request is sufficient. The data processed
        before we receive your request may still be legally processed.</p>
    <p>We will retain the data you provide on the contact form until you request its deletion, revoke your consent for its storage,
        or the purpose for its storage no longer pertains (e.g. after fulfilling your request). Any mandatory statutory provisions,
        especially those regarding mandatory data retention periods, remain unaffected by this provision.</p>
    <h3>Registration on this website</h3>
    <p>You can register on our website in order to access additional functions offered here. The input data will only be used
        for the purpose of using the respective site or service for which you have registered. The mandatory information
        requested during registration must be provided in full. Otherwise, we will reject your registration.</p>
    <p>To inform you about important changes such as those within the scope of our site or technical changes, we will use the
        email address specified during registration.</p>
    <p>We will process the data provided during registration only based on your consent per Art. 6 (1)(a) DSGVO. You may revoke
        your consent at any time with future effect. An informal email making this request is sufficient. The data processed
        before we receive your request may still be legally processed.</p>
    <p>We will continue to store the data collected during registration for as long as you remain registered on our website.
        Statutory retention periods remain unaffected.</p>
    <h3>Registration with Facebook Connect</h3>
    <p>Instead of registering directly on our website, you may also register using Facebook Connect. This service is provided
        by Facebook Ireland Limited, 4 Grand Canal Square, Dublin 2, Ireland.</p>
    <p>If you decide to register with Facebook Connect and click on the "Login with Facebook" or "Connect with Facebook" buttons,
        you will be automatically redirected to the Facebook platform. There you can log in with your Facebook username and
        password. This will link your Facebook profile to our website or services. This link gives us access to your data
        stored on Facebook. Including especially your:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Facebook name</li>
        <li>Facebook profile picture</li>
        <li>Facebook cover picture</li>
        <li>Email address provided to Facebook</li>

        <li>Gender</li>

    <h3>Leaving comments on this website</h3>
    <p>If you use the comment function on this site, the time at which you created the comment and your email address will be
        stored along with your comment, as well as your username, unless you are posting anonymously.</p>
    <p>
        <strong>Storage of the IP address</strong>
    </p>
    <p>Our comment function stores the IP addresses of those users who post comments. Since we do not check comments on our
        site before they go live, we need this information to be able to pursue action for illegal or slanderous content.</p>
    <p>
        <strong>Subscribing to the comment feed</strong>
    </p>
    <p>As a user of this site, you can sign up to receive the comment feed after registering. Your email address will be checked
        with a confirmation email. You can unsubscribe from this function at any time by clicking the link in the emails.
        The data provided when you subscribed to the comments feed will then be deleted, but if you have submitted this data
        to us for other purposes or elsewhere (such as subscribing to a newsletter), it will be retained.</p>
    <p>
        <strong>How long comments are stored</strong>
    </p>
    <p>The comments and the associated data (e.g. IP address) are stored and remain on our website until the content commented
        upon has been completely deleted or the comments are required to be removed for legal reasons (slander, etc.).</p>
    <p>
        <strong>Legal basis</strong>
    </p>
    <p>The comments are stored based on your consent per Art. 6 (1) (a) DSGVO. You may revoke your consent at any time with
        future effect. An informal email making this request is sufficient. The data processed before we receive your request
        may still be legally processed.</p>
    <h3>Processing of data (customer and contract data)</h3>
    <p>We collect, process, and use personal data only insofar as it is necessary to establish, or modify legal relationships
        with us (master data). This is done based on Art. 6 (1) (b) DSGVO, which allows the processing of data to fulfill
        a contract or for measures preliminary to a contract. We collect, process and use your personal data when accessing
        our website (usage data) only to the extent required to enable you to access our service or to bill you for the same.</p>
    <p>Collected customer data shall be deleted after completion of the order or termination of the business relationship. Legal
        retention periods remain unaffected.</p>
    <h3>Data transmitted when entering into a contract with online shops, retailers, and mail order</h3>
    <p>We transmit personally identifiable data to third parties only to the extent required to fulfill the terms of your contract,
        for example, to companies entrusted to deliver goods to your location or banks entrusted to process your payments.
        Your data will not be transmitted for any other purpose unless you have given your express permission to do so. Your
        data will not be disclosed to third parties for advertising purposes without your express consent.</p>
    <p>The basis for data processing is Art. 6 (1) (b) DSGVO, which allows the processing of data to fulfill a contract or for
        measures preliminary to a contract.</p>
    <h3>Data transferred when signing up for services and digital content</h3>
    <p>We transmit personally identifiable data to third parties only to the extent required to fulfill the terms of your contract
        with us, for example, to banks entrusted to process your payments.</p>
    <p>Your data will not be transmitted for any other purpose unless you have given your express permission to do so. Your
        data will not be disclosed to third parties for advertising purposes without your express consent.</p>
