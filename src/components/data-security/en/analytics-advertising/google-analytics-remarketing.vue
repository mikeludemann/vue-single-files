		<h3>Google Analytics Remarketing</h3>
		<p>Our websites use the features of Google Analytics Remarketing combined with the cross-device capabilities of Google AdWords
			and DoubleClick. This service is provided by Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheater Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA.</p>
		<p>This feature makes it possible to link target audiences for promotional marketing created with Google Analytics Remarketing
			to the cross-device capabilities of Google AdWords and Google DoubleClick. This allows advertising to be displayed
			based on your personal interests, identified based on your previous usage and surfing behavior on one device (e.g.
			your mobile phone), on other devices (such as a tablet or computer).</p>
		<p>Once you have given your consent, Google will associate your web and app browsing history with your Google Account for
			this purpose. That way, any device that signs in to your Google Account can use the same personalized promotional
			messaging.</p>
		<p>To support this feature, Google Analytics collects Google-authenticated IDs of users that are temporarily linked to our
			Google Analytics data to define and create audiences for cross-device ad promotion.</p>
		<p>You can permanently opt out of cross-device remarketing/targeting by turning off personalized advertising in your Google
			Account; follow this link:
			<a href="https://www.google.com/settings/ads/onweb/" target="_blank">https://www.google.com/settings/ads/onweb/</a>.</p>
		<p>The aggregation of the data collected in your Google Account data is based solely on your consent, which you may give
			or withdraw from Google per Art. 6 (1) (a) DSGVO. For data collection operations not merged into your Google Account
			(for example, because you do not have a Google Account or have objected to the merge), the collection of data is
			based on Art. 6 (1) (f) DSGVO. The website operator has a legitimate interest in analyzing anonymous user behavior
			for promotional purposes.</p>
