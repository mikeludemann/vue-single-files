    <h3>Facebook Pixel</h3>
    <p>Our website measures conversions using visitor action pixels from Facebook, Facebook Inc., 1601 S. California Ave, Palo
        Alto, CA 94304, USA ("Facebook").</p>
    <p>These allow the behavior of site visitors to be tracked after they click on a Facebook ad to reach the provider's website.
        This allows an analysis of the effectiveness of Facebook advertisements for statistical and market research purposes
        and their future optimization. </p>
    <p>The data collected is anonymous to us as operators of this website and we cannot use it to draw any conclusions about
        our users' identities. However, the data are stored and processed by Facebook, which may make a connection to your
        Facebook profile and which may use the data for its own advertising purposes, as stipulated in the
        <a href="https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/"
            target="_blank">Facebook privacy policy</a>. This will allow Facebook to display ads both on Facebook and on third-party sites. We
        have no control over how this data is used.</p>
