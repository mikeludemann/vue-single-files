    <h3>Google reCAPTCHA</h3>
    <p>We use "Google reCAPTCHA" (hereinafter "reCAPTCHA") on our websites. This service is provided by Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheater
        Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA ("Google").</p>
    <p>reCAPTCHA is used to check whether the data entered on our website (such as on a contact form) has been entered by a
        human or by an automated program. To do this, reCAPTCHA analyzes the behavior of the website visitor based on various
        characteristics. This analysis starts automatically as soon as the website visitor enters the website. For the analysis,
        reCAPTCHA evaluates various information (e.g. IP address, how long the visitor has been on the website, or mouse
        movements made by the user). The data collected during the analysis will be forwarded to Google.</p>
    <p>The reCAPTCHA analyses take place completely in the background. Website visitors are not advised that such an analysis
        is taking place.</p>
    <p>Data processing is based on Art. 6 (1) (f) DSGVO. The website operator has a legitimate interest in protecting its site
        from abusive automated crawling and spam.</p>
