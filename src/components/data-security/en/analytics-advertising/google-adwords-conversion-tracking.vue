		<h3>Google AdWords and Google Conversion Tracking</h3>
		<p>This website uses Google AdWords. AdWords is an online advertising program from Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheater Parkway,
			Mountain View, CA 94043, United States ("Google").</p>
		<p>As part of Google AdWords, we use so-called conversion tracking. When you click on an ad served by Google, a conversion
			tracking cookie is set. Cookies are small text files that your internet browser stores on your computer. These cookies
			expire after 30 days and are not used for personal identification of the user. Should the user visit certain pages
			of the website and the cookie has not yet expired, Google and the website can tell that the user clicked on the ad
			and proceeded to that page.</p>
		<p>Each Google AdWords advertiser has a different cookie. Thus, cookies cannot be tracked using the website of an AdWords
			advertiser. The information obtained using the conversion cookie is used to create conversion statistics for the
			AdWords advertisers who have opted for conversion tracking. Customers are told the total number of users who clicked
			on their ad and were redirected to a conversion tracking tag page. However, advertisers do not obtain any information
			that can be used to personally identify users. If you do not want to participate in tracking, you can opt-out of
			this by easily disabling the Google Conversion Tracking cookie by changing your browser settings. In doing so, you
			will not be included in the conversion tracking statistics.</p>
		<p>Conversion cookies are stored based on Art. 6 (1) (f) DSGVO. The website operator has a legitimate interest in analyzing
			user behavior to optimize both its website and its advertising.</p>
		<p>For more information about Google AdWords and Google Conversion Tracking, see the Google Privacy Policy:
			<a href="https://www.google.de/policies/privacy/"
				target="_blank">https://www.google.de/policies/privacy/</a>.</p>
		<p>You can configure your browser to inform you about the use of cookies so that you can decide on a case-by-case basis
			whether to accept or reject a cookie. Alternatively, your browser can be configured to automatically accept cookies
			under certain conditions or to always reject them, or to automatically delete cookies when closing your browser.
			Disabling cookies may limit the functionality of this website.</p>
