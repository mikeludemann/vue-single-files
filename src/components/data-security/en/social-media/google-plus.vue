		<h3>Google+ plugin</h3>
		<p>Our pages use Google+ functions. It is operated by Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA.</p>
		<p>Collection and disclosure of information: Using the Google +1 button allows you to publish information worldwide. By
			means of the Google+ button, you and other users can receive custom content from Google and our partners. Google
			stores both the fact that you have +1'd a piece of content and information about the page you were viewing when you
            clicked +1. Your +1 can be displayed together with your profile name and photo in Google services, for example in
            search results or in your Google profile, or in other places on websites and advertisements on the Internet.</p>
        <p>Google records information about your +1 activities to improve Google services for you and others. To use the Google
            + button, you need a globally visible, public Google profile that must contain at least the name chosen for the profile.
            This name is used by all Google services. In some cases, this name may also replace a different name that you have
            used to share content via your Google account. The identity of your Google profile can be shown to users who know
            your email address or other information that can identify you.</p>
        <p>Use of collected data: In addition to the uses mentioned above, the information you provide is used in accordance with
            the applicable Google data protection policies. Google may publish summary statistics about users' +1 activity or
			share it with users and partners, such as publishers, advertisers, or affiliate websites.</p>
