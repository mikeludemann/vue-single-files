      you could be personally identified. This privacy policy explains what information we collect and what we use it for.
      It also explains how and for what purpose this happens.</p>
  <p>Please note that data transmitted via the internet (e.g. via email communication) may be subject to security breaches.
      Complete protection of your data from third-party access is not possible.</p>

  <p>The responsible party is the natural or legal person who alone or jointly with others decides on the purposes and means

  <h3>Right to file complaints with regulatory authorities</h3>

      regulatory authorities. The competent regulatory authority for matters related to data protection legislation is

  <h3>Right to data portability</h3>
  <p>You have the right to have data which we process based on your consent or in fulfillment of a contract automatically
      delivered to yourself or to a third party in a standard, machine-readable format. If you require the direct transfer
      of data to another responsible party, this will only be done to the extent technically feasible.</p>
  <h3>SSL or TLS encryption</h3>
  <p>This site uses SSL or TLS encryption for security reasons and for the protection of the transmission of confidential
      content, such as the inquiries you send to us as the site operator. You can recognize an encrypted connection in
      your browser's address line when it changes from "http://" to "https://" and the lock icon is displayed in your browser's
      address bar.</p>
  <p>If SSL or TLS encryption is activated, the data you transfer to us cannot be read by third parties.</p>
  <h3>Encrypted payments on this website</h3>
  <p>If you enter into a contract which requires you to send us your payment information (e.g. account number for direct debits),
      we will require this data to process your payment.</p>
  <p>Payment transactions using common means of payment (Visa/MasterCard, direct debit) are only made via encrypted SSL or
      TLS connections. You can recognize an encrypted connection in your browser's address line when it changes from "http://"
      to "https://" and the lock icon in your browser line is visible.</p>
  <p>In the case of encrypted communication, any payment details you submit to us cannot be read by third parties.</p>
  <h3>Information, blocking, deletion</h3>
  <p>As permitted by law, you have the right to be provided at any time with information free of charge about any of your
      personal data that is stored as well as its origin, the recipient and the purpose for which it has been processed.
      You also have the right to have this data corrected, blocked or deleted. You can contact us at any time using the
      address given in our legal notice if you have further questions on the topic of personal data.</p>
  <h3>Opposition to promotional emails</h3>
  <p>We hereby expressly prohibit the use of contact data published in the context of website legal notice requirements with
      regard to sending promotional and informational materials not expressly requested. The website operator reserves
      the right to take specific legal action if unsolicited advertising material, such as email spam, is received.</p>
