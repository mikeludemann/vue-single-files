		<h3>CleverReach</h3>
		<p>This website uses CleverReach to send newsletters. The supplier is CleverReach GmbH & Co. KG, MÃ¼hlenstr. 43, 26180 Rastede.
			CleverReach is a service which organizes and analyzes the distribution of newsletters. The data you provide (e.g.
			your email address) to subscribe to our newsletter will be stored on CleverReach servers in Germany.</p>
		<p>Sending our newsletters with CleverReach enables us to analyze the behavior of newsletter recipients. Among other things,
			we can find out how many recipients have opened the email containing the newsletter and how often various links contained
			therein are clicked. With the help of conversion tracking, we can also analyze whether a predefined action (such
			as the purchase of a product on our website) takes place after clicking on the link in the newsletter. For more information
			on how data is analyzed by CleverReach, please visit
			<a href="https://www.cleverreach.com/de/funktionen/reporting-und-tracking/"
				target="_blank">https://www.cleverreach.com/de/funktionen/reporting-und-tracking/</a>.</p>
		<p>Data processing is based on Art. 6 (1) (a) DSGVO. You may revoke your consent at any time by unsubscribing to the newsletter.
			The data processed before we receive your request may still be legally processed.</p>
		<p>If you do not want your usage of the newsletter to be analyzed by CleverReach, you will have to unsubscribe from the
			newsletter. For this purpose, we provide a link in every newsletter we send. You can also unsubscribe from the newsletter
			directly on the website.</p>
		<p>The data provided when registering for the newsletter will be used to distribute the newsletter until you cancel your
			subscription when said data will be deleted from our servers and those of CleverReach. Data we have stored for other
			purposes (e.g. email addresses for the members area) remains unaffected.</p>

			<strong>Completion of an outsourced data processing contract</strong>
