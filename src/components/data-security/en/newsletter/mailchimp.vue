    <h3>MailChimp</h3>
    <p>This website uses the services of MailChimp to send newsletters. This service is provided by Rocket Science Group LLC,
        675 Ponce De Leon Ave NE, Suite 5000, Atlanta, GA 30308, USA.</p>
    <p>MailChimp is a service which organizes and analyzes the distribution of newsletters. If you provide data (e.g. your email
        address) to subscribe to our newsletter, it will be stored on MailChimp servers in the USA.</p>
    <p>MailChimp is certified under the EU-US Privacy Shield. The Privacy Shield is an agreement between the European Union
        (EU) and the US to ensure compliance with European privacy standards in the United States.</p>
    <p>We use MailChimp to analyze our newsletter campaigns. When you open an email sent by MailChimp, a file included in the
        email (called a web beacon) connects to MailChimp's servers in the United States. This allows us to determine if
        a newsletter message has been opened and which links you click on. In addition, technical information is collected
        (e.g. time of retrieval, IP address, browser type, and operating system). This information cannot be assigned to
        a specific recipient. It is used exclusively for the statistical analysis of our newsletter campaigns. The results
        of these analyses can be used to better tailor future newsletters to your interests.</p>
    <p>If you do not want your usage of the newsletter to be analyzed by MailChimp, you will have to unsubscribe from the newsletter.
        For this purpose, we provide a link in every newsletter we send. You can also unsubscribe from the newsletter directly
        on the website.</p>
    <p>Data processing is based on Art. 6 (1) (a) DSGVO. You may revoke your consent at any time by unsubscribing to the newsletter.
        The data processed before we receive your request may still be legally processed.</p>
    <p>The data provided when registering for the newsletter will be used to distribute the newsletter until you cancel your
        subscription when said data will be deleted from our servers and those of MailChimp. Data we have stored for other
        purposes (e.g. email addresses for the members area) remains unaffected.</p>
