		<h3>Newsletter2Go</h3>
		<p>This website uses Newsletter2Go to send newsletters. The provider of this service is Newsletter2Go GmbH, Nürnberger Straße
			8, 10787 Berlin, Germany.</p>
		<p>Newsletter2Go is a service which organizes and analyzes the distribution of newsletters. The data you provide to subscribe
			to our newsletter will be stored on Newsletter2Go servers in Germany.</p>
		<p>If you do not want your usage of the newsletter to be analyzed by Newsletter2Go, you will have to unsubscribe from the
			newsletter. For this purpose, we provide a link in every newsletter we send. You can also unsubscribe from the newsletter
			directly on the website.</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Data analysis by Newsletter2Go</strong>
		</p>
		<p>We use Newsletter2Go to analyze our newsletter campaigns. This allows us to determine if a newsletter message has been
			opened and which links you click on. We can thus find out how often various links are clicked.</p>
		<p>In addition, we can see if certain actions take place after clicking on said links (conversion rate). We can thus determine
			whether the clicking of a link in a newsletter has led to a purchase, for example.</p>
		<p>Newsletter2Go also allows us to classify newsletter recipients into different categories (clustering). For example, newsletter
			recipients can be subdivided according to gender, personal preference (e.g. vegetarian or non-vegetarian), or customer
			relationship (e.g. existing or potential customer). This allows us to adapt the newsletters to the respective target
			groups.</p>

			<strong>Legal basis</strong>
		</p>
		<p>Data processing is based on Art. 6 (1) (a) DSGVO. You may revoke your consent at any time. The data processed before
			we receive your request may still be legally processed.</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Storage duration</strong>
		</p>
		<p>The data provided when registering for the newsletter will be used to distribute the newsletter until you cancel your
			subscription when said data will be deleted from our servers and those of Newsletter2Go. Data we have stored for
			other purposes (e.g. email addresses for the members area) remains unaffected.</p>
