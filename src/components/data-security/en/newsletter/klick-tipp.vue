    <h3>Klick-Tipp</h3>
    <p>This website uses Klick-Tipp to send newsletters. This service is provided by KLICK-TIPP LIMITED, 15 Cambridge Court,
        210 Shepherd's Bush Road, London W6 7NJ, United Kingdom.</p>
    <p>Klick-Tipp is a service which organizes and analyzes the distribution of newsletters. The data you provide to subscribe
        to our newsletter will be stored on Klick-Tipp servers.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Data analysis by Klick-Tipp</strong>
    </p>
    <p>If we send out newsletters with the help of Klick-Tipp, we can determine if a newsletter message has been opened and
        which links have been clicked on.</p>
    <p>Klick-Tipp also allows us to classify newsletter recipients into different categories (tagging). For example, newsletter
        recipients can be subdivided according to gender, personal preference (e.g. vegetarian or non-vegetarian), or customer
        relationship (e.g. existing or potential customer). This allows us to adapt the newsletters to the respective target
        groups. For more information, please visit
        <a href="https://www.klick-tipp.com" target="_blank">https://www.klick-tipp.com</a> and
        <a href="https://www.klick-tipp.com/handbuch" target="_blank">https://www.klick-tipp.com/handbuch</a>.</p>
    <p>If you do not want your usage of the newsletter to be analyzed by Klick-Tipp, you will have to unsubscribe from the newsletter.
        For this purpose, we provide a link in every newsletter we send. You can also unsubscribe from the newsletter directly
        on the website.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Legal basis</strong>
    </p>
    <p>Data processing is based on Art. 6 (1) (a) DSGVO. You may revoke your consent at any time. The data processed before
        we receive your request may still be legally processed.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Storage duration</strong>
    </p>
    <p>The data provided when registering for the newsletter will be used to distribute the newsletter until you cancel your
        subscription when said data will be deleted from our servers and those of Klick-Tipp. Data we have stored for other
        purposes (e.g. email addresses for the members area) remains unaffected.</p>

    <p>
      <strong>Completion of an outsourced data processing contract</strong>

        of our customers and not to disclose said data to third parties.</p>
