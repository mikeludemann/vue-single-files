		<h3>Rapidmail</h3>
		<p>This website uses Rapidmail to send newsletters. This service is provided by rapidmail GmbH, Augustinerplatz 2, 79098
			Freiburg, Germany.</p>
		<p>Rapidmail is a service which organizes and analyzes the distribution of newsletters. The data you provide to subscribe
			to our newsletter will be stored on Rapidmail servers in Germany.</p>
		<p>If you do not want your usage of the newsletter to be analyzed by Rapidmail, you will have to unsubscribe from the newsletter.
			For this purpose, we provide a link in every newsletter we send. You can also unsubscribe from the newsletter directly
			on the website.</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Data analysis by Rapidmail</strong>
		</p>
		<p>For analysis purposes, emails sent with Rapidmail contain a tracking pixel which connects to Rapidmail servers when the
			email is opened. This allows us to determine if a newsletter message has been opened.</p>
		<p>It also helps us determine which links have been clicked on. All links in the email are tracking links that allow us
			to count your clicks.</p>
		<p>For more information about the analysis functions of Rapidmail, please refer to the following link:

			<strong>Legal basis</strong>
		</p>
		<p>Data processing is based on Art. 6 (1) (a) DSGVO. You may revoke your consent at any time. The data processed before
			we receive your request may still be legally processed.</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Storage duration</strong>
		</p>
		<p>The data provided when registering for the newsletter will be used to distribute the newsletter until you cancel your
			subscription when said data will be deleted from our servers and those of Rapidmail. Data we have stored for other
			purposes (e.g. email addresses for the members area) remains unaffected.</p>
