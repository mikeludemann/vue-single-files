		<h3>CleverElements</h3>
		<p>This website uses CleverReach to send newsletters. This service is provided by CleverElements GmbH, Prinzessinnenstr.
			19-20, 10969 Berlin, Germany.</p>
		<p>CleverElements is a service which organizes and analyzes the distribution of newsletters. The data you provide to subscribe
			to our newsletter will be stored on CleverElements servers in Germany.</p>
		<p>If you do not want your usage of the newsletter to be analyzed by CleverElements, you will have to unsubscribe from the
			newsletter. For this purpose, we provide a link in every newsletter we send. You can also unsubscribe from the newsletter
			directly on the website.</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Data analysis by CleverElements</strong>
		</p>
		<p>We use CleverElements to analyze our newsletter campaigns. This allows us to determine if a newsletter message has been
			opened and which links you click on. We can thus find out how often various links are clicked.</p>
		<p>CleverElements also allows us to classify newsletter recipients into different categories (e.g. by place of residence).
			This allows us to adapt the newsletters to the respective target groups.</p>
		<p>For detailed information on the functions of CleverElements, see the following link:

		<p>
			<strong>Legal basis</strong>
		</p>
		<p>Data processing is based on Art. 6 (1) (a) DSGVO. You may revoke your consent at any time. The data processed before
			we receive your request may still be legally processed.</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Storage duration</strong>
		</p>
		<p>The data provided when registering for the newsletter will be used to distribute the newsletter until you cancel your
			subscription when said data will be deleted from our servers and those of CleverElements. Data we have stored for
			other purposes (e.g. email addresses for the members area) remains unaffected.</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Completion of an outsourced data processing contract</strong>
		</p>
		<p>We have entered into a data processing agreement with CleverElements, in which we require CleverElements to protect the
			data of our customers and not to disclose said data to third parties. </p>
